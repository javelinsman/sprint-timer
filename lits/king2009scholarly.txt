ntroduction

Faculty and students were surveyed at
five US universities, as part of an Institute of Museum and Library Service
(IMLS) grant to the University of Tennessee, School of Information Sciences.1 The
purpose of the study, entitled ‘Maximizing
Library Investments in Digital Collections
Through Better Data Gathering and Analysis (MaxData)’ was to examine alternative
means of collecting journal and article usage
metrics including readership surveys, local
server hits and downloads, data provided by
various vendors, and deep log analysis
(by CIBER, University College London) of
electronic journal usage data collected by
OhioLINK. The findings were intended to
enable librarians to learn what conclusions
can be drawn from each metric, the
strengths and weaknesses of each one, how
Donald W.
they complement one another, and what
King
conclusions can be drawn if only one source
of data is available. This article addresses
the survey of faculty of the five universities.
The following question was asked to place
journal information-seeking and reading
patterns in context: ‘What sources did you
use for the last substantive piece of information you used for work? (Select all that
Carol Tenopir
apply).’ Results are shown in Figure 1.
Clearly, journal articles dominate as a
source of information used by faculty for
work. It is significant that websites are used
for about one-third of the time, although the
type of website information is not established.

sometimes know about the information
reported or discussed in an article prior to
reading it for the first time. In fact, readers
said that they knew about the information in
nearly half of the articles they last read
(49.5%). The readers first found out about
the information from the sources shown in

ABSTRACT. Surveys at five US universities show that
faculty read articles for research, teaching, writing, and
other purposes; the largest number of readings is for
research. The time spent reading scholarly articles (an
estimated average of 132 hours and 240 articles per year)
demonstrates their value to faculty’s work; over one-third
of readings are reported to be absolutely essential, and to
affect the reader’s purpose in many ways, including helping
to improve results, or to broaden or change the focus.
Faculty prefer print for personal subscriptions, although
library electronic collections provide a majority of readings,
and most readings from library collections are from
electronic sources; older articles are also more commonly
from electronic library collections. Faculty use a variety of
means to find articles, including browsing and searching,
the latter particularly for research purposes, and to locate
older articles. Faculty members who publish more, or who
have won awards, read more articles on average than their
less productive or successful colleagues.

Again, journal articles are found to be an
important source of information. However, it
is clear that information is communicated
through many channels with articles being
only a single channel in this information
flow, although an important one. Various
authors describe the flow of research information from discovery through oral and written
reporting over time, with journal articles
being somewhat down the chain in time.2–5
Prior research
Voluminous prior research has examined
multiple aspects of information-seeking and
reading patterns. Those studies that focus

specifically on scholarly article reading are
summarized in several literature reviews.6–10
The research literature is well covered in
these reviews; this article therefore does not
attempt to review all of the many hundreds
of specific scholarly reading studies. In addition, there is a vast literature on how
individual differences influence the adoption
of technology; this topic is outside the scope
of the present article.11
The literature that explores how differences in situation and context influence
information-seeking patterns is also vast;
factors such as motivation or purpose of a
search have been shown to play a role in
information-seeking behaviors.12–15 Most

journal articles
are found to be

respondents

most recently

studies do not focus on the act of scholarly
article reading, but rather on the information-seeking process; however, many studies
do demonstrate that the same individual
may exhibit many different informationseeking patterns, depending on the purpose
for which the information is needed.
Although this article aggregates findings,
there are certainly some differences across
demographic characteristics of readers. Differences in reading patterns result most
often from differences in academic disciplines,16,17 followed by readers’ primary
duties (teaching or research),9 their productivity (faculty who publish more, read
more),5 and their age (older faculty are more
likely to read print and to have more personal subscriptions).18,19
Limited availability of training, e-journals,
and computing infrastructure may be a barrier to the use of e-journals, thus affecting
user behavior.20 In the universities studied
here, that was not the case as all had access
to substantial print and electronic journals
collections from their libraries, and robust
technological infrastructure from their universities.
Method
Self-reported data on scholarly article reading were collected through a Web-based
survey to faculty members (academic staff)
at five universities in the United States
(University of Akron, Ashland University,
Case Western Reserve University, Malone
College, and University of Tennessee).
Three of the five are research-extensive or
-intensive (Ph.D.-granting) universities, and
two award masters’ degrees. Together the
five universities include academic programs
in all major areas, including medicine and
other health-related fields, engineering, sciences (including all major life and physical
sciences), social sciences (including law,
business, and education), and humanities
(including arts, literature, and history). All
have extensive print and electronic journal
collections with robust computing infrastructure; hence availability and access to
scholarly journals was not a problem for any
of the faculty respondents.
In most cases, a random sample of faculty

LEARNED PUBLISHING

VOL. 22

members at each university received an email
from the university librarian with an embedded link to the Web-based survey instrument
housed on the University of Tennessee
server. A follow-up email and, in some cases,
announcements of the survey in various
library-originated university publications or
meetings helped to increase the response
rate to a level of between 19% at one university and over 40% at two universities.
Surveys were distributed in October–
November 2005. Respondents could skip
any question or exit the survey at any time.
All responses were anonymous, with no
identifying information recorded. In all,
1,307 faculty members responded to at least
some of the questions. The questions asked
in all of the university surveys were for the
most part the same, in the same order. Small
variations were made in the demographic
question on academic discipline, to reflect
the subject departments within a particular
university, and in the question on the ‘source’
of a reading, to reflect the names given to
the online catalogs and systems of each
specific university. All of these responses
were recoded consistently to enable analysis.
All the survey instruments and details of
each individual university’s responses are
available at http://web.utk.edu/~tenopir/
research/ survey_instruments.html
In addition to standard demographic questions about the respondent’s age, gender,
and subject discipline, the majority of questions focused on scholarly journal reading
and use, beginning with a single recollection
question of how many scholarly articles they
had read in the past month. Respondents
were then asked to focus on the specific article they had read most recently. This
variation of the critical incident technique21
asks detailed questions relating to the last
reading and improves the likelihood that
respondents will remember specific information. The unit of observation thus becomes a
reading of a scholarly article, and the universe of readings being sampled is all
readings by the faculty population over the
past month. A two-stage sample is taken,
where the first stage is the readers and the
second stage is the critical incident of one
reading, which is assumed to be ‘random’ in
time.22,23

Questions about the last article read provide relevant cross-classifications such as
how older articles are identified and obtained; the format of personal subscription
and library-provided articles that are read;
and the purposes of reading from personal
subscriptions, library-provided articles, and
articles obtained from author websites.
Scholarly journal information-reading
patterns
Questions on information-reading patterns
covered the amount of reading, time spent
reading, thoroughness of the reading, whether
the last reading was a re-reading of the article, purpose of reading, and outcomes from
reading. Faculty were asked just one recollection question: the total number of articles
they had read in the past month. All other
questions related to the last article reading.
Reading is defined as follows:
In the past month (30 days), approximately how many scholarly articles have
you read? Articles can include those found
in journal issues, websites, or separate copies such as preprints, reprints, and other
electronic or paper copies. Reading is defined as going beyond the table of contents, title, and abstract to the body of the
article.
This definition has been used in over 50
surveys since the mid-1970s, with minor
changes to reflect changes in technology.24–28 Changes in the results over time are

129

not included here, but are described in detail
in a forthcoming article.29
Amount of reading and time spent reading
Of 1,307 faculty member respondents, only
1.5% said they had not read an article in the
past month. The range of articles read in the
past month is highly skewed, as shown in
Figure 3.
The extensive reading by some may reflect
occasional in-depth literature reviews, but
also includes regular scanning of the literature to keep current.
The average number of readings is 22.6
readings per month (or about 271 annual
readings if we assume reading is evenly
spread throughout the year), or 20 readings
(240 readings per year) if outliers are
excluded. These results reflect readings and
not articles read, since some articles are read
multiple times by faculty. For example,
20.3% of the last readings were from an article that had been previously read, although
the number of previous readings of each
article was not determined.
Readers were asked how thoroughly they
read the last article and how much time they
spent reading it. Most said they read the
article with great care (42.9% of readings) or
with attention to the main points (50.6%),
but only 6.4% of the readings were said to be
just to get the idea. The average time spent
reading the last article was 33.1 minutes; for
half of the readings it was 25 minutes or less.
Nearly 10% of the readings were 3 hours or

more. Faculty’s time, of course, is one of
their most important resources and, therefore, the time spent reading scholarly journal
articles is an indicator of the value they
place on the information obtained. Faculty
average about 132 hours per year reading
scholarly articles; the figure is even higher
when the time required to identify and
obtain the articles is also taken into account
(see below).
Purpose and outcome of reading
Another indicator of the usefulness and
value of information gained from reading is
the purpose of reading, and the ways in

which the information affects these purposes. Respondents were asked: ‘For what
principal purpose did you use, or do you plan
to use, the information obtained from the
article you last read? (Choose only the one
best answer).’ The results are shown in
Figure 4.
Nearly all the readers (99.5%) thought
the reading of the article had some effect on
their principal purpose. Ways in which their
principal purpose was affected are depicted
in Figure 5.
Readers were then asked how important
the information in the article was in achieving the principal purpose. The results are
shown in Figure 6.

The information obtained from reading
scholarly articles is clearly important to
scholars’ work.
Scholarly journal information-seeking
patterns
Readers identify and obtain articles using a
variety of methods and sources. They
become aware of articles they read by browsing journals to which they have access
through personal or library subscriptions; by
searching the literature and then obtaining
articles from library collections or other
sources (library electronic collections in fact
provide a majority of readings); by reading
about them in the literature; or through
someone telling them about the articles.
Reading patterns vary substantially, depending on how readers identify articles and the
sources used to obtain them. Other aspects

of information-seeking include the format
used to obtain and read articles, and the
location at which the articles are read. The
preferred format and location reflect the
time and effort needed to use them. The age
of the articles read is also an important
aspect of information-seeking; older articles
require special information-seeking methods.
All of these aspects of information-seeking
affect, or are affected by, the usefulness and
value of the article information content (see
below).

older articles
require special
informationseeking methods

How readers become aware of articles
Readers most often become aware of articles
through browsing (e.g. starting with a journal title, journal issue, or table of contents)
or through online searching (in person or by
someone on their behalf) by subject or by
author’s name. Other means by which readFigure 7. How

ers become aware of articles they read are
shown in Figure 7 as a percentage of readings.
The journal sources browsed (e.g. personal
or library subscriptions) vary according to
format, as shown in Figure 8.
Most browsing is from a print version of
articles (61.4%), which reflects the fact that
print personal subscriptions continue to be
preferred by faculty readers, even though
electronic versions are available for many
scholarly journals. In fact, almost all reading
from personal subscriptions tends to be of
print versions. Faculty have on average 2.38
personal subscriptions to print-only journals,
0.62 subscriptions to electronic-only journals, and 1.07 subscriptions to journals that
offer both versions. (Personal subscriptions
are those that are personally addressed to
the individual at his or her home, office, or
laboratory.)

The format of browsing has a bearing on
the amount of time spent identifying an
article. The average time spent browsing is
6.9 minutes per reading. Since about 86
readings on average per reader are from
browsing (i.e. 35.7% of 240 annual readings), about 9.9 hours a year are spent by
faculty readers browsing for articles. The
time spent depends on format, and on
whether the article is found from a personal
or library subscription. Generally, browsing
from electronic sources appears to take less
time than browsing print versions (6.7 vs.
7.1 minutes), although this varies slightly
according to the source, as shown in Figure
9. Where browsing takes place may also
have some bearing on browsing time.
Most reading as a result of online searching (58.3% of such readings) is from searches
in electronic abstracting and indexing

(A&I) services such as Academic Search
Premier, ERIC, PsycINFO, etc. Interestingly,
print A&I products continue to be searched,
although for a very small percentage of readings (1.7%). Other sources of online searches
are given in Figure 10.
Readers (or someone on their behalf such
as a student, assistant, or librarian) also
spend time finding articles identified by
searching, with an average time spent on
retrieval of 5.3 minutes. About one-quarter
(i.e. 64, or 26.7% of 240) of yearly readings
on average are found by searching. This
means that readers average about 5.6 hours
per year searching for articles, in addition to
9.9 hours browsing and 132 hours reading –
a total of 147.5 hours.
Sources used to obtain articles
Most articles are read from journals to which

the reader has access via a personal or library
subscription; they may also be accessible
through school or departmental subscriptions (which are often supported by the main
library), or articles may be requested via
interlibrary loan or a document delivery
service. Other sources include an author
website or a copy provided by someone else
such as a colleague or the author. The percentages of readings from these sources are
shown in Figure 11.
More article readings are from electronic
sources than from print (54.4% vs. 45.6%).
However, as shown in Figure 12, readings
from personal subscriptions continue to be
primarily from print versions (87.4% print
vs. 12.6% electronic). On the other hand,
most library-provided articles are read from
electronic versions (71.2% electronic vs.
28.8% print). More readings from other

from 32.8% for 2005 articles to 11.7% of
those published prior to 1996; those found
through citations fell from 27.2% for
pre-1996 articles to 20.5% for 2005 articles;
and those identified by other individuals
dropped from 47.6% for 2005 articles to
7.5% for pre-1996 articles.
Table 3 shows where readers obtained the
articles read, by the age of the articles. Articles published in 2005 were most often
provided by libraries (44.8% of readings of
these articles); however, as articles get older,
libraries become an increasingly important
source while reading from personal subscriptions diminishes. The percentage of reading
from other sources (i.e. copies from authors,
colleagues, and others; free Web journals;
preprint copies, etc.) remains about the
same regardless of age. Where articles are
found by browsing, most come from personal
subscriptions regardless of the age of the

around 60 years earlier (1943 and 1947).
Both of these were found from citations in
other articles and then obtained from a print
library copy. The percentage of readings by
age of article is given in Figure 13.
How articles are identified, and where
they are obtained, is affected by their age, as
shown in Tables 1–3. As Table 1 shows, articles published in 2005 (prior to October/
November when the survey was done) were
largely identified through browsing (56.3%),
but the older the articles were, the more
likely they were to be identified by other
means. Articles published prior to 1996 were
mostly identified through citations (46.5%)
and searching (32.3%).
Table 2 provides another way of looking at
the same data: 72.6% of articles found by
browsing were recently published, diminishing to 1.9% for articles published prior to
1996. Articles found by searching decreased

articles (79.7% of articles published in 2005,
as opposed to 69.8% of those published prior
to 2004). This demonstrates the continued
importance of print personal subscriptions,
particularly for browsing.
Retrospective conversion of print journals
to electronic format has had an important
impact on information-seeking. The format
of reading by age of article is given in Table
4. While reading of print and electronic versions is about equal for articles published in
2005, articles from the preceding nine years
(1996–2004) are more often read in electronic format. Reading of articles published
prior to 1996 tends to be in print, probably
reflecting the lower availability of earlier
content in electronic databases. Access to
electronic versions of articles has an important effect on readers’ time, since accessing
library collections remotely saves them time.
Information-seeking for research, teaching,
and other purposes
Articles are read for many reasons such
as conducting research, teaching, writing
(articles, reports, proposals, etc.), current
awareness (keeping up with the literature),
for one’s continuing education and for other
purposes (e.g. administration, making presentations, or advising others). Readers’
information-seeking patterns tend to vary

depending on whether the information is
read for research, teaching, or current
awareness (and continuing education). For
example, the way in which readers became
aware of the articles they read varies substantially between these three purposes of
reading (Table 5). Some browsing is done for
research (30.9%), but most articles read for
research are identified by other means.
Teaching requires keeping current for
classes, and this is reflected in the percentage of reading found by browsing (44.1%).
As might be expected, browsing accounts for
about 64.7% of reading for current awareness or personal continuing education.
The source from which articles are
obtained also varies according to the purposes for which the information is read
(Table 6). Libraries are the most common
source for all three purposes above. The
library is a particularly important source for
research (64.7% of reading). This is because
articles generally found from searching, citations, and other persons are older articles
which, when identified, need to be located
and then obtained (for which libraries are
well suited).
The source format of the articles read for
these three purposes (Table 7) reflects the
means used to become aware of them, not
the final format when reading. Most brows-

ing is from personal subscriptions which are
read in print, and this is clearly reflected in
the percentage of reading from print versions for all three purposes (see Table 5).
Value of scholarly journals
There are many ways to assess the value of
information services and products. For
example, some equate value to the valueadded attributes of the service or product.30
Here value is described from three perspectives. Machlup31 describes the value of information in two ways:
앫 Purchase or exchange value: what one is

willing to pay in time and/or money for
the information found in journals.
앫 Use value: the favorable consequences
derived from reading and using the information.
In the following section, purchase value is
related to the time readers spend reading
articles; they would not devote this time if
the information did not have some value to
them. It also reflects the price paid for
personal subscriptions. Use value can be
characterized in many ways. One indicator
of the value of articles is the number of times
they are cited. The purposes of reading, and
the importance of the information for these
purposes, are other indicators of use value. A

third perspective for assessing value is contingent valuation, which is an economic
method used to assess the benefits of
non-priced goods and services (e.g. journals
or library services); this is done by examining
the implication of not having the product or
service.32,33 A more in-depth discussion of
value is given by Tenopir and King.5,34
Purchase value of scholarly journals
One indicator of the value of information
services and products is what users are willing to pay for them in their time and/or
money. As we have seen, faculty readers
spend on average nearly 150 hours per year
in information-seeking and reading. There is
very little difference in the time spent per
article reading of print versions compared
with electronic (32.9 minutes for print vs.
33.4 for electronic), and the time spent
identifying and obtaining print and electronic versions of articles only differs by
about one or two minutes per article when
all sources are considered together. Thus one
could conclude that there is little difference
in the price readers are willing to pay in their
time for print and electronic versions. However, the time spent reading library-provided
articles (an average of 35.4 minutes) is
somewhat higher than that spent on personal subscriptions (27.9 minutes). About

Source of last-read article (%)

34 minutes per article are spent reading
items obtained from other sources.
There are several reasons that readers
spend less time reading articles from personal subscriptions. One is that much of the
reading of personal subscriptions is done for
current awareness, keeping up, or for personal continuing education (22.7% of
personal subscription reading). This type of
information-seeking often involves scanning
of articles, which does not take much time
per reading; on the other hand, when a faculty member searches for information there
is usually a specific purpose in mind, which
leads to more in-depth reading. For example,
38% of articles found by browsing are read
for 15 minutes or less, versus 31% of articles
found by searching.
Most (75.6%) articles found by searching
are obtained from library-provided means.
This is because articles identified in this way
often need to be located and then obtained,
and the most logical source is the library.
Furthermore, more time is spent reading
older articles, as shown in Table 8.

The purchase value indicated by time
spent reading also varies depending on purpose, as shown in Figure 14. More time is
spent reading for the purpose of conducting
research and writing than for other purposes,
which suggests that this information is more
valuable to the readers for these purposes.
Not surprisingly, the least time is spent reading for current awareness.
Use value of scholarly articles
Faculty members were asked whether they
had received any awards or special recognition in the past two years for their research
or other profession-related contributions.
About one-third of the faculty indicated
they had received such recognition. Those
who had been recognized averaged 23 readings of scholarly articles in the past month,
compared with 18.5 readings by those who
had not. The annual time spent reading was
159 hours for the award-winners and 119
hours for the remainder. These results demonstrate that achievers tend to read more,

and to spend more time reading articles.
This, of course, does not mean that if you
just read more you will receive awards!
Faculty frequently publish as part of their
responsibilities; the average number of publications by faculty in the five surveyed
universities in the past two years is shown
in Figure 15. Just as in reading, scholarly
articles also dominate authorship, again
indicating the value of scholarly articles to
faculty as authors as well as readers. Only
14.3% of faculty had not authored any scholarly publications in the past two years. Most
faculty (74.4%) had authored at least one
scholarly article. The percentage of faculty
that had authored at least one of the other
publications is as follows: chapters in scholarly books, proceedings, etc. (40.3%), nonrefereed articles (31.0%), and books (9.7%).
Authorship is one indicator of faculty
output (or productivity). An indicator of the

value of scholarly journal information is
therefore whether the amount of reading
is related to authorship. Unfortunately,
respondents were not asked about the number of co-authors, so the output cannot be
weighted.33 However, the overall authorship
is definitely related to reading, as shown in
Figure 16: those who publish read more than
those who do not. While one responsibility
of faculty is to publish, the fact that those
who do so (in any type of publication) tend
to read more articles than those who do not
is an indication that they find articles to be
of particular use.

service.33,34 The faculty survey addressed
contingent valuation using the following set
of questions:
Thinking back to the source of the [lastread] article, where would you obtain the
information if that source were not available?
(a) I would not bother getting the information
(b) I would obtain the information from
another source. Please specify the
source__
If b) is checked:

the current cost
in reader time
to identify and
obtain articles
is about 28
hours

In order to obtain the same information, if
this source were not available, I would expect to spend ___ minutes of time and/or
$___. (If the answer is zero, please enter
‘0’ instead of leaving blank.)
A total of 1,098 of 1,307 faculty members
answered this question.
The contingent valuation analysis estimates how much it would cost readers in
their time and/or money to use alternative
sources, if they did not have the resources
they used to obtain their most recently read
articles. The net benefit of having such
sources is found by subtracting the current
cost from the alternative cost, which is a
measure of contingent valuation.
Faculty reported that they would not
bother getting the information for 19% of
the readings. (This is typical of most other
surveys that asked this question, dating back
to the mid-1970s.) The remaining readers
indicated they would spend an average of
about 32 minutes and $8.20 per reading to
obtain the information from another source;
the maximum time reported was about four
hours, and the maximum cost about $250
(although only about one-third of respondents would spend any money). With an
average of 194 (i.e. 0.81 × 240) readings per
year in which alternative sources are sought,
the average annual cost in time is 103 hours
per faculty member (i.e. 194 × 32 minutes/
60), and in money about $1,590 (i.e. 194 ×
$8.20). The current cost in reader time to
identify and obtain articles is about 28
hours, i.e. 15.5 total hours browsing and
searching; in addition there are costs for
appropriate discussions with colleagues and

LEARNED PUBLISHING

VOL. 22

locating, photocopying, and downloading
print, etc. These costs, based on another
study, come to 12.5 hours and $67 for
photocopying and $60 for downloading and
printing.35,36 Therefore, it would cost faculty
about 75 more hours to obtain the information and $1,463 in other costs (i.e. $1,590 –
$127) if articles were not available.
This analysis is more meaningful when
examining the sources used. For example, we
may examine the contingent valuation of
library-provided access to articles. Faculty
read an average of 125 articles from
library-provided sources, and they said they
would seek alternative sources for 99 of
these if they were not available from the
library (i.e. 79% of these readers said they
would use an alternative source); the figures
below reflect the costs associated with those
125 readings only. The cost of using alternatives is estimated to be an average of 36
minutes per article in the reader’s time and
about $10.00 per article in money expended.
Therefore, the total annual cost to a faculty
member of using alternative sources could be
as high as 59 hours in time plus $990 for subscriptions, travel, communication, etc. The
current cost to readers of obtaining this
information from library-provided articles is
about 10 hours per reader, with a cost (to
libraries) of $160 per faculty member.36 Thus
the library collection saves the university 49
hours of time and $830 for subscriptions,
etc., per faculty member.
Because faculty can access and read
library collections remotely, they save an
average of about 7 hours annually through
no longer having to visit the library; previously, the time cost would have been 17
hours. In other studies32,33,36,37 in which
detailed library costs were established and a
dollar value placed on faculty time, the
return on the university’s investment (ROI)
was estimated to be between $2.9 and $4.4
for every dollar expended on the library budget. At the University of Illinois, for
example, there was estimated to be $4.38
returned in grants for every dollar expended
on the library. This was estimated by multiplying the number and dollar amounts of
grants received by university faculty by
the percentage of those grant proposals
that included citations from the university

library, and comparing that figure with the
budget expenditures on the library.37
Open access and information-seeking
patterns
There is a great deal of interest in the provision of open access (OA) to scholarly
research articles, either through publication
in OA journals (sometimes funded by
author-side payments), or through making
copies of articles (often in a pre-publication
version) available in institutional or subject-based repositories and/or on author
websites; in the latter case, publisher policies
sometimes require an embargo period, such
as six months following publication, before
the article may be made freely available. The
surveys did not isolate which articles (or
journals) read are OA by either definition –
readers may not know whether an article is
open access. However, some articles read by
the survey respondents are likely to have
been OA: e.g. free Web journals; electronic
copies obtained from colleagues, authors, or
others; electronic preprint copies; copies
from author or other websites. The information-seeking and reading patterns involving
these articles are potential indicators of
‘open access’ patterns. In particular, the
authors examined how readers became
aware of such articles, the age of the articles
read, their sources, their format, the purpose
for which they were read them, how reading
affected these purposes, and the time spent
reading these articles.

these articles are shown in Figure 17. ‘OA’
articles tend to be more frequently identified
through searching or through information

OA articles tend to be much newer than
the other articles read (Table 9). No OA
articles read by survey respondents were
published prior to 1987, although 5.1% of
other articles were published prior to that
time. It is not clear to what extent OA
authors archive their articles in their
websites or institutional repositories some
time after publication; this would have a
bearing on the age at which OA articles are
read.
OA articles are more likely to be read on a
computer screen than other articles (42.3%
of readings vs. 29.2%). Perhaps for this
reason, they are slightly less likely to be read
with great care (39.3% vs. 43.3%) and less
time is spent reading them (30 vs. 32 minutes). On the other hand, readers require
less time to obtain the OA articles (4.5 minutes vs. 5.7 minutes). The OA articles are
read for virtually the same purposes as other

almost exactly the same.
Conclusion

authors of all
types of
publications
tend to read
journal articles
more than do
non-authors

The surveys of faculty in five US universities
provide abundant evidence of the continued
substantial usefulness and value of scholarly
journals and articles.
앫 There is estimated to be an average of 240
readings per faculty per year.
앫 Faculty average about 130 hours per year
reading scholarly articles – time they
would be unwilling to spend if the information was not valuable to them.
앫 Journal articles are observed to be by far
the most used source of information by
faculty.
앫 Faculty author more refereed scholarly articles than any other type of publication;
another study33 indicates that they spend
nearly 100 hours per article doing so.
Authors of all types of publications tend to
read journal articles more than do nonauthors.
앫 Most reading (80.4% of readings) is for
research, teaching or writing; readers indicate that over one-third of readings are
‘absolutely essential’ to achieving such
purposes.
앫 The last reading is often said to affect
these purposes by inspiring new thinking
or ideas; improving the results; narrowing,
broadening or changing the focus of
research, teaching, etc.; or saving time or
other resources.
앫 Faculty whose research or other profession-related contributions has recently
been recognized through awards or other
means read more scholarly journal articles
than those who have not received such
recognition.
These indicators of the usefulness and
value of scholarly journals and articles are
typical of the results observed over the past
three decades for faculty as well as professionals working in other settings.29
Every article reading is unique in its combination of information-seeking and reading
pattern (i.e. time spent obtaining and reading, means of learning about the article, age
of the article, source of the article, location
where read, format of the article, past know-

LEARNED PUBLISHING

VOL. 22

ledge of information found in the article,
prior reading of the article, principal purpose
of reading, and outcome from reading).
Given this complexity of article informationseeking and reading patterns, it makes sense
to observe aspects of each respondent’s most
recent reading of an article. Analysis of these
patterns leads to the following conclusions:
앫 Faculty prefer to read print versions of
personal subscriptions.
앫 Library journal collections are primarily
read in electronic versions away from the
library.
앫 Readers become aware of articles through
many means: browsing a journal issue or
table of contents is the most frequent, followed by searching by subject or author
name, through information from another
person, or through a citation in another
publication.
앫 About half of articles found by browsing
are from print versions of personal subscriptions; about one-fourth are from
electronic versions from library or departmental collections.
앫 Most searching is from electronic abstracting and indexing (A&I) services (58.3%
of readings from searching), followed by
online journal collections (20.2%); only
14.0% are found through Web search
engines.
앫 Over half of readings are from libraryprovided articles, including school or department collections and articles obtained
from interlibrary borrowing or document
delivery (which are mostly electronic versions – 71.2%). About one-third of all
readings are from personal subscriptions
(which are mostly print versions – 87.5%).
앫 Overall, over half of readings are from
electronic versions (54.4% of all readings)
of which most are downloaded and
printed out for reading (68.7% of readings
from electronic versions).
앫 About half (50.2%) of readings are from
articles published in the past 12 months.
Articles have a long ‘half-life’; some articles read are many years old (e.g. 2.8%
over 25 years old).
앫 In the first year after publication articles
are read about equally in print and electronic versions, but from the second year
to 10 years old, about two-thirds of read-

ings are from electronic versions. Many of
the print readings in the first year are from
browsing print personal subscriptions. After the tenth year, print versions begin to
dominate, indicating that retrospective
conversion of journal backfiles is still far
from complete.
앫 Articles found by browsing are mostly recent, but older articles predominate in
readings from searching, and even more so
for those from citations.
앫 Articles obtained from personal subscriptions are mostly recent; most of these
readings are found by browsing for the
purpose of keeping current. The percentage obtained from library-provided articles
increases to nearly three-fourths of readings of articles over 10 years old. The
percentage of articles obtained from other
sources remains about the same over age
(about 20%).
앫 The way that older articles are identified,
and how they are obtained, is important
because older articles tend to be rated as
more useful in terms of purpose of use and
as measured by time spent reading.
It is clear that faculty members locate articles using a variety of methods (browsing,
searching, etc.) and from a variety of sources
(library-provided, personal subscriptions,
open Web, colleagues, etc.). The library is
the main source for electronic articles, since
most readings from library collections are
from electronic versions. Readings from personal subscriptions are still mostly in print.
The fact that there is no single method of
identifying or obtaining articles is important
to both publishers and librarians. Publishers
must realize that print personal subscriptions
are still important, particularly for browsing
and reading for current awareness; readings
for research and writing are more often of
older articles, and are more likely to come
from the library collection. The typical faculty member’s reading patterns are made up
of a range of strategies, sources, and formats.
Articles are an important part of faculty
members’ research, teaching, and other work
needs, and they must have access to them in
a variety of ways.
